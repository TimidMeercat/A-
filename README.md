## A* Search for 8 puzzle

A python program to solve an 8 puzzle using heuristics.

### Getting Started
The program uses manhattan distance as heuristic and bisect sort for quick sorting.\
To use the number of squares that are not in the right place as heuristic, simple replace 'f2value' with fvalue in line 179.

### Execution

* Step 1: Run A*.py file.
* Step 2: Enter the 8 puzzle problem starting state with **0** as blank tile.
```
Example:
        1 0 3
        4 2 6
        7 5 8 
```

* Step 3: The program tries to find a path, if found, it prints out the path and steps.
